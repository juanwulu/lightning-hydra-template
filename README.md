## Description

This is a general template repository for prototyping deep learning models with [`Lightning`](https://lightning.ai/) library and [`Hydra`](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/) configuration management system. The implementation is forked from the original [`lightning-hydra-template`](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template) by [ashleve](https://github.com/ashleve) in order to:

- Simplify the dependency tree.
- Embrace modern Python project structure ([PEP 621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/)).
- Improve flexibility in workflow for prototyping and experimenting with large neural networks.
